health_intelligence_system

A non-diagnostic, data-driven mental health intelligence platform that focuses on awareness, trends, and self-reflection rather than medical conclusions.

This module is part of a broader Health Intelligence System and is designed to analyze mental health screening data longitudinally (over time), not as one-off scores.


🎯 Objective

The goal of this system is to help users understand patterns in their mental well-being using:

standardized mental health screening tools

time-series analysis

confidence and uncertainty awareness

reflective, non-clinical insights

⚠️ This system is not a medical diagnostic tool and does not provide treatment or therapy.
